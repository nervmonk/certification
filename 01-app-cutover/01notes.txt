Cutting over (or going live) with a web application involves transitioning from a staging or legacy environment to a production one. A well-managed cutover ensures minimal downtime, preserves data integrity, and avoids user disruption. Here's a typical approach:

âœ… 1. Planning & Preparation
Key Activities:

Define cutover strategy: big bang (all at once) vs. phased (gradual rollout).

Create a cutover checklist: steps, responsible teams, timing.

Identify rollback plan: know exactly how to revert if issues arise.

Communicate with stakeholders: internal teams, end users, support.

ðŸ§ª 2. Final Testing
Key Activities:

Complete end-to-end testing in staging.

Perform performance/load testing.

Conduct UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

Validate backup & restore procedures.

âŒš 3. Freeze & Final Prep
Key Activities:

Code freeze on staging and production.

Final data sync/migration rehearsal.

Set up monitoring/alerting tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, Sentry).

Confirm domain cutover strategy (e.g., DNS TTL settings).

ðŸš€ 4. Cutover Execution
Key Activities:

Schedule cutover during low-traffic hours.

Take final backups of the old system.

Perform data migration/final sync (if not live-synced).

Deploy to production.

Update DNS/domain routing (if applicable).

Verify app health (automated smoke tests, health checks).

âœ… 5. Post-Cutover Verification
Key Activities:

Run smoke tests and real-world scenario tests.

Monitor logs, error rates, and system metrics.

Confirm user login, transaction, and core workflows.

ðŸ”„ 6. Rollback Plan (if needed)
If serious issues are found:

Revert DNS/domain.

Restore backups.

Notify stakeholders and support team.

ðŸ§¹ 7. Cleanup & Handoff
Key Activities:

Decommission old infrastructure (after a safety window).

Finalize documentation.

Conduct a post-mortem/retrospective for learnings.

Would you like a customizable template or checklist for your team? Or do you have a specific cutover (e.g., legacy to cloud, greenfield app launch, blue/green deployment) in mind?
