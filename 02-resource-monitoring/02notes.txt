✅ 1. Monitoring Tools
You’ll usually rely on monitoring and observability tools to track system metrics:

Popular Tools:
Prometheus + Grafana: Metric collection + customizable dashboards and alerts.

Datadog: Full-stack observability with anomaly detection.

New Relic: APM (Application Performance Monitoring) with user behavior analytics.

AWS CloudWatch / Azure Monitor / Google Cloud Operations Suite: Cloud-native options if you're on a major cloud provider.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log-based monitoring.

✅ 2. Metrics to Monitor
Here are critical resource areas and what you typically watch:

Server & Infrastructure:
CPU Usage (e.g., >85% for 5 minutes)

Memory Usage (e.g., sustained above 90%)

Disk I/O and Space

Network traffic and errors

Instance health checks (e.g., EC2 status or container liveness probes)

Application Level:
Response time / latency (e.g., 95th percentile > 500ms)

Error rates (5xx errors, 4xx spikes)

Queue lengths / throughput

Thread or connection pool exhaustion

Database:
Query performance

Connection pool usage

Replication lag

✅ 3. Setting Thresholds and Alerts
Thresholds should be based on baselines and SLOs (Service Level Objectives). Examples:

CPU usage > 85% for 5 minutes → alert

95th percentile response time > 2s → alert

Disk space < 10% remaining → alert

Error rate > 1% of all requests in last 5 minutes → alert

Alerts can be configured in tools like Prometheus Alertmanager, Datadog monitors, or CloudWatch Alarms.

✅ 4. Alerting Channels
Set up notifications for alerting through:

Slack, Microsoft Teams

PagerDuty / Opsgenie

SMS / Email

✅ 5. Auto-Remediation (Optional but Powerful)
For some thresholds, consider auto-responses:

Auto-scale instances or containers

Restart services or pods

Clear cache or rotate logs

✅ 6. Visualization and Dashboards
Use Grafana, Datadog, or built-in dashboards to get real-time visibility:

Traffic heatmaps

Latency over time

Error rate histograms

Resource usage trends

✅ 7. Logging and Tracing
Use:

Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog APM)

Structured logging (JSON logs, centralized log ingestion)

Correlate logs and traces with metrics to pinpoint failure points quickly.

Summary Workflow
Collect metrics/logs/traces

Analyze against thresholds (with anomaly detection or manual rules)

Alert relevant teams or services

Respond manually or automatically

Visualize trends to prevent future issues
