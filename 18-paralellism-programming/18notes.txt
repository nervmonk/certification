Parallelism in the context of Java code refers to the ability to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, leveraging multiple CPU cores to improve performance and efficiency. This is particularly useful for computationally intensive tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks.

In Java, parallelism can be achieved through various mechanisms:

Threads: Java provides built-in support for multithreading, allowing developers to create and manage multiple threads of execution. Each thread can run concurrently, enabling parallel execution of tasks.
Executor Framework: The java.util.concurrent package includes the Executor framework, which simplifies the management of threads. It provides thread pools and other utilities to execute tasks asynchronously.
Fork/Join Framework: Introduced in Java 7, the Fork/Join framework is designed for parallel processing of tasks that can be broken down into smaller subtasks. It uses a work-stealing algorithm to efficiently distribute tasks among available threads.
Streams API: The Streams API, introduced in Java 8, allows for functional-style operations on collections. It includes support for parallel streams, which can process data in parallel, automatically utilizing multiple threads.
CompletableFuture: This class provides a way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code. It allows for the composition of multiple asynchronous tasks and can be used to achieve parallelism in a more declarative manner.
By using these features, Java developers can write code that takes advantage of modern multi-core processors, leading to improved performance for applications that require concurrent processing. However, it's important to manage shared resources carefully to avoid issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.
